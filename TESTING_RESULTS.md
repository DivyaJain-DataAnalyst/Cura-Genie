## 🚀 Ready to Test!

### Start Your Local Development Environment

#### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd C:\Users\xhgme\curagenie-cleaned

# Double-click this file to start both services
start-all.bat
```

#### Option 2: Manual Start
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
.\start-backend.bat

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
.\start-frontend.bat
```

### Access Your Application
- 🌐 **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- 🛠️ **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000  
- 📚 **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- 🔍 **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

## 🧪 What to Test

### Core Functionality ✅
1. **Homepage loads** correctly
2. **Navigation works** between all pages
3. **Authentication pages** render properly
4. **Dashboard displays** with all components
5. **API communication** between frontend and backend
6. **Database operations** work correctly

### Expected Behavior
- **Backend**: Runs in minimal mode with core features working
- **Frontend**: Full UI functionality with all pages accessible
- **API**: Basic endpoints respond correctly
- **Database**: SQLite tables created and functional

### Known Limitations (Expected)
- Some ML/AI features may show placeholder data
- Advanced genomic analysis may be limited
- Enhanced MRI features may not be fully active

**This is normal for local testing!** The cleaned structure ensures all deployment dependencies are properly configured.

## 📝 Testing Checklist

Complete this checklist as you test:

### Backend Testing
- [ ] Backend starts without errors
- [ ] http://localhost:8000 shows API information
- [ ] http://localhost:8000/health returns "healthy" status
- [ ] http://localhost:8000/docs shows interactive API documentation
- [ ] Database file (curagenie.db) is created in backend directory

### Frontend Testing
- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost:3000
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Pages load without console errors
- [ ] Authentication pages render correctly
- [ ] Dashboard displays properly
- [ ] Responsive design works on different screen sizes

### Integration Testing  
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console
- [ ] Form submissions work
- [ ] File upload components render
- [ ] Real-time features initialize

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check:

1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 and 8000 are available
2. **Dependencies**: Run installation commands again if needed
3. **Environment files**: Verify .env and .env.local are configured
4. **Browser cache**: Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or different browser
